## Core Principles and Project Foundation

**Project Initialization and Maintenance (Focus on Existing System):**

- **Purpose:**  Understand and maintain the existing foundation of the ERP project, focusing on identifying and addressing roadblocks to full functionality.
- **`cline_docs` Folder:** Maintain a `cline_docs` folder in the root directory (create if it doesn't exist) with essential documentation for understanding the existing ERP structure.
- **`projectRoadmap.md`:**  Outline the high-level goals for achieving a fully functional and deployable SaaS ERP. This should include identifying key features still needing attention, defining completion criteria for each, and tracking progress on debugging and issue resolution. Update when goals change or significant milestones in fixing the ERP are completed. Include a "completed tasks" section to maintain a history of resolved issues. Format with `##` for main goals and checkboxes (`- [ ]` / `- [x]`) for tasks. Consider future scalability for the SaaS deployment. This integrates the tracking purpose of the original `memlog` folder.
- **`currentTask.md`:** Document the current debugging or development objectives, relevant context about the issue being addressed, and the planned next steps for resolution. Update after completing each debugging step or subtask. Explicitly reference related issues or tasks from `projectRoadmap.md`. Format with `##` for main sections and bullet points for details. This also integrates the tracking purpose of the original `memlog` folder at a granular level.
- **`techStack.md`:** Detail the key technologies and architectural decisions used in the existing ERP system. This is crucial for understanding the context of the issues. Update when significant technology decisions are clarified or changed. Format with `##` for categories and bullet points for specifics. This is the "our tech stack" you will be an expert in.
- **`codebaseSummary.md`:** Provide a concise overview of the existing ERP project structure and recent changes made during the debugging process. Update with significant structural changes or as understanding of the existing system improves. Include sections on Key Components and Their Interactions (with a focus on ERP modules and their integration), Data Flow (especially relevant for understanding transaction processing and potential bottlenecks), External Dependencies (including libraries, APIs, versions), Recent Significant Changes (related to debugging and fixes), and User Feedback Integration and Its Impact on Development (if user feedback is guiding the debugging process). Format with `##` for main sections, `###` for components, and bullet points for details.
- **Additional Documentation:** Create reference documents (e.g., `databaseSchema.md`, `apiEndpoints.md`, or module-specific diagrams) as needed in the `cline_docs` folder to aid in understanding the existing system and note them in `codebaseSummary.md`.
- **Initial Check:** Before responding to user requests, verify the existence and, if necessary, update the `cline_docs` folder and its contents based on recent debugging efforts and discoveries about the system. This ensures a current understanding of the ERP's state.

**Task Execution (Debugging and Issue Resolution):**

- **Purpose:** Break down the problem of a non-fully functional ERP into actionable debugging and fixing steps.
- **Detailed Steps:** Split debugging tasks into **clear, numbered steps** with explanations for actions and reasoning in French. Explain the debugging methodologies being used (e.g., step-through debugging, log analysis).
- **Proactive Issue Identification:** Identify and flag potential issues or cascading effects that might arise from the current debugging effort before they occur. Explain potential root causes based on your ERP expertise.
- **Step Verification:** Verify the outcome of each debugging step (e.g., confirming a bug is reproduced, verifying a fix) before proceeding.
- **Error Handling and Recovery:** If errors occur during debugging or while testing a fix, document them thoroughly, revert to previous stable states or debugging steps, and retry with modified approaches as needed. Document errors and debugging attempts in the relevant `cline_docs` files (likely `currentTask.md` or a dedicated `debugLog.md` if needed) in French.

## Secure Practices (Relevant for SaaS Deployment):

- **Purpose:** Ensure secure practices are in place, especially as the ERP is being prepared for SaaS deployment.
- **Credential Management:**  Understand how credentials are currently managed in the ERP. If issues are found, clearly explain the purpose of any credential-related information needed from the user in French. Guide users in obtaining or resetting credentials if necessary. Validate credentials before performing any actions. Provide guidance on secure storage of sensitive information, emphasizing best practices for SaaS applications. Recommend proper refresh procedures for expiring credentials.
- **Focus on Secure Deployment:** As you help debug, consider security implications for SaaS deployment, such as access controls, data encryption (at rest and in transit), and secure API design.

## Code Quality and Organization (For Maintainability and Debugging):

- **File Handling:** Understand the existing file organization. If issues are found, guide towards ensuring files are organized, modular, and maintainable.
- **Modular Design:**  If monolithic components are hindering debugging, suggest breaking them down into smaller, more manageable sections. Explain the benefits of modularity for maintainability and debugging.
- **Separate Configuration:**  If configuration is hardcoded or scattered, suggest storing constants, configurations, and reusable strings in separate, well-defined files.
- **Descriptive Naming:** If naming conventions are unclear, encourage the use of descriptive names for files and folders for clarity in French.
- **Dependency Management:**  Verify and document all file dependencies to understand the system's structure.

**Dependencies and Libraries (For Stability and Security):**

- **Purpose:** Ensure the ERP uses stable, compatible, and maintainable libraries, especially considering security vulnerabilities.
- **Stable Versions:**  Verify the ERP uses the most stable versions of dependencies to ensure compatibility and security. Explain the risks of using outdated libraries.
- **Regular Updates:** Recommend a process for regularly updating libraries, avoiding changes that disrupt functionality. Document version requirements and updates in `techStack.md` and `codebaseSummary.md`.

**Code Documentation (Crucial for Understanding Existing Code):**

- **Purpose:** Improve understanding of the existing ERP code through clear and consistent documentation.
- **Clear Comments:** Write clear, concise comments for all sections of code in French, especially in areas being debugged.
- **Docstrings:** Use **one set of triple quotes** for docstrings to prevent syntax errors.
- **Function and Module Documentation:** Document the purpose and expected behavior of functions and modules in French, focusing on critical parts of the ERP.

**Change Review (For Debugging and Preventing Regressions):**

- **Purpose:** Evaluate the impact of any code changes made during the debugging process to ensure stability and prevent regressions.
- **Impact Assessment:** Review all changes made to assess their effect on other parts of the ERP system.
- **Thorough Testing:** Test changes thoroughly to ensure consistency and prevent conflicts.
- **Change Logging:** Document all changes made during debugging, their outcomes (success or failure), and any corrective actions taken in the relevant `cline_docs` files (likely `currentTask.md` and summarized in `codebaseSummary.md`) in French. This includes documenting unsuccessful attempts and the reasoning behind them.

## Communication and Integration (Understanding System Interactions):

**Error Reporting (During Debugging):**

- **Purpose:** Provide actionable feedback about errors encountered during the debugging process and maintain a log of these errors.
- **Detailed Error Reports:** Create detailed error reports, including the context in which the error occurred, timestamps, and the full error message, documenting them in the relevant `cline_docs` files in French.
- **Recovery Suggestions:** Suggest potential recovery steps or alternative debugging approaches for the user in French.
- **Error History Tracking:** Track the history of errors encountered during debugging to identify patterns and potential root causes (potentially in a dedicated section within `codebaseSummary.md` or in `debugLog.md`).
- **Escalation:** If you are unable to resolve an issue, clearly document the problem and the steps taken so far.

**Third-Party Services (If Integrated with the ERP):**

- **Purpose:** Understand and verify connections to any third-party services the ERP depends on.
- **Complete Setup:** Ensure all necessary configurations and permissions for third-party services are in place and documented in `techStack.md`.
- **Connection Testing:** Test connections to third-party services to rule out integration issues as a source of problems.
- **Service Documentation:** Document version requirements, service dependencies, and expected behavior for any integrated third-party services in `techStack.md`.
- **Contingency Planning:** If issues with third-party services are suspected, consider potential fallback strategies.

## Workflow and User Interaction

### Adaptive Workflow
- At the beginning of every task when instructed to "follow your custom instructions", read the essential documents in this order to understand the current state of the ERP and the ongoing debugging efforts:
  1. `projectRoadmap.md` (for high-level goals and the plan for achieving a functional ERP)
  2. `currentTask.md` (for the specific debugging objective and context)
  3. `techStack.md` (to understand the technologies involved)
  4. `codebaseSummary.md` (for an overview of the ERP's structure and recent changes).
- If you try to read or edit another document before reading these, something BAD will happen.
- Update documents based on significant findings during debugging or when a clear understanding of an issue is reached, not for every minor step.
- If conflicting information is found between documents, ask the user for clarification in French.
- Create files in the `userInstructions` folder for tasks that require user action (e.g., running specific commands, providing configuration details).
  - Provide detailed, step-by-step instructions in French.
  - Include all necessary details for ease of use.
  - No need for a formal structure, but ensure clarity and completeness.
  - Use numbered lists for sequential steps, code blocks for commands or code snippets.
- Prioritize frequent testing:  Encourage running tests or specific ERP functionalities regularly after making changes to verify fixes and identify new issues early.

## User Interaction and Adaptive Behavior
- Ask follow-up questions in French when critical information is missing to understand the problem or guide the debugging process.
- Adjust your approach based on the complexity of the ERP issue and the user's level of understanding.
- Strive for efficient problem-solving with minimal back-and-forth.
- Present key technical findings and potential solutions concisely, allowing for user feedback and input.

## Code Editing and File Operations
- When guiding code modifications, ensure the proposed changes are well-organized and aligned with the existing ERP project structure.
- Refer to the main Cline system for specific file handling instructions.

**Browser Rules (Thoroughness in Debugging):**

- **Purpose:** Exhaust all potential avenues when investigating a bug before concluding it's not solvable or not in a particular area.
- **Comprehensive Evaluation:** When evaluating a potential cause or solution, check related components and functionalities in all directions: **up/down** the call stack and **left/right** across related modules or data flows.
- **Conclusion Only After Testing:** Only conclude that a particular area is not the source of the problem after thoroughly testing all possibilities within that area.

Remember, your primary goal is to guide users in making our existing ERP system fully functional and ready for SaaS deployment through effective debugging and problem-solving, while maintaining comprehensive project documentation.
