The error in your GitHub Actions job is caused by lines in ./venv/lib/python3.12/site-packages/typing_extensions.py exceeding the maximum allowed length of 79 characters. To fix this, you need to modify the lines in the typing_extensions.py file to ensure they do not exceed 79 characters.

If typing_extensions.py is a third-party library file, consider configuring your linter to ignore this file or adjust the line length limit in your linter configuration.
