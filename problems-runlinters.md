Error Analysis
The job logs indicate multiple issues primarily related to code formatting and unused imports. Here are the key errors:

Whitespace Issues: Several tests contain lines with whitespace errors (e.g., blank lines containing whitespace, missing newlines at end of file).
Import Errors: Many files have unused imports, which are flagged by the linter.
Expected Blank Lines: Several lines are missing the expected number of blank lines as per the linter's configuration.
Unused Variables: There are instances where variables are assigned but never used.
Fix Suggestions
Remove Unused Imports: Delete any imports that are not used in the code.
Correct Whitespace Issues:
Ensure no trailing whitespace in blank lines.
Add missing newlines at the end of files.
Adjust Blank Lines: Ensure the correct number of blank lines as required by the linter.
Remove Unused Variables: Delete variables that are assigned but never used.
