The error in the job logs is due to multiple instances of lines being too long in the typing_extensions.py file. Each line exceeds the maximum allowed length of 79 characters, indicating a PEP 8 style violation.

To fix this error, you need to reformat the lines in the typing_extensions.py file to ensure they are within the 79-character limit. You can achieve this by breaking long lines into multiple shorter lines or by using line continuation characters.
